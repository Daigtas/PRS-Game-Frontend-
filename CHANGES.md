# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game - Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Fixed Infinite useEffect Loop
- In `App.js`, removed the unnecessary check for `currentUser.token` since we're using cookie-based authentication.
- Updated API calls to use the `getApiHeaders()` helper consistently.

### 2. Added Layout Shift Prevention
- The `PlayBoard` component already had a placeholder implementation with `<div className="result-placeholder">VS</div>` that shows when results are not displayed.
- This ensures that the UI doesn't jump around when the computer is making its choice.

### 3. Fixed Highscore Updates
- Added immediate UI updates when a new highscore is achieved for better user feedback.
- Added comprehensive error logging and verification of server responses.
- Added checks to verify the current user's highscore is properly updated in both UI and server.

### 4. CORS Configuration
- Updated `config.js` to use HTTPS for API endpoints in production to avoid mixed content errors.
- Created proper documentation in `DEPLOYMENT.md` for configuring the server with HTTPS and CORS headers.

## Testing the Changes

1. **Test the Login and Registration Flow**
   - Register a new account
   - Log in with that account
   - Verify the user's highscore is displayed correctly

2. **Test the Game Flow**
   - Play several games to increase your score
   - Verify that when you win enough games, your highscore updates
   - Check the highscores list to see your score

3. **Test the Highscore Update Mechanism**
   - Use the included test tool (`test-highscore-update.html`) to verify the highscore update API

## Development Tools

- `start-dev.bat` - Starts both the mock API server and the React development server
- `start-mock-api.bat` - Starts only the mock API server for testing
- `build-test.bat` - Builds the application for testing purposes
- `test-highscore-update.html` - A standalone test tool to verify highscore updates

## Deployment Instructions

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions, including:
- API server setup with HTTPS
